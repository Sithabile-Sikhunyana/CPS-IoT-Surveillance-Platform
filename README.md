# CPS--IoT-surveillance-platform.

The overarching objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-driven IoT surveillance system capable of accurately identifying security breaches amidst the vast sea of network traffic.This system will be implemented as a CPS-IoT surveillance platform,encompassing two distinct setups to assess performance under normal and attack scenarios:

1. MQTT Network Setup: Operating with normal and attacked traffic to generate datasets
from network logs.
2. Developed Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB) Network Setup (MQTT+): Operating with
normal and attacked traffic, based on a newly developed broker model called MQTT+ that
enhances the standard MQTT protocol by introducing advanced filtering, queuing, and
machine learning functionalities.
Both setups will involve comprehensive dataset generation and the application of machine
learning models to derive insights from the IoT network data.
